Business Problem:\
The client reported the following issues that they face with business:
1. Not receiving clicks for their ads

3. Decreasing sales

My Approach:\ 
I defined the problem statements and identified the metrics to be measured to find solution to their business problems.

Analyzed various ad campaigns against bounce rate, engagement rate and clicks.
Performed customer churn analysis 
Performed product analysis

Insights\
Identified the reasons for decreasing sales as:\
1. loss of customers
2. very low customer retention rate
3. no YOY growth in customers
4. poor marketing/wrong usage of keywords
5. Ad campaigns released on low performing/ineffective channels
6. Top performing products are not further promoted and low performing products are completely neglected without promoting

Suggestions to the marketing department\
1. Identified low performing products and suggested boost for them
2. Identified lost customers recently and suggested marketing department to contact them directly and then follow up through promotion emails
3. Identified the top keywords that would fetch maximum clicks and engagement with minimum bounce rate
4. Identified the best ad campaign medium for the marketing department to choose for future marketing activities

Conclusion\
Prepared a detailed video presentation on the report generated in Microsoft Power BI and shared that with the client.

Result\
The client was extremely happy at the findings, provided recommendation in LinkedIn and later informed me that the insights helped them to increase customer base by 25% and net profit by 30%. Also, around 40% of website visitors could be converted to potential customers.
